# dynamo_lib
In which I develop a wrapper around wpgu-rs to create a graphics development engine in rust.

I'm currently simultaneously developing a Pong game using this engine, which is also a public repo. 

Future plans will be to master 2d game development (get a few built with this engine, tetries, bricks, what have you) and proceed to 3d game development, following the same idea.

Feel free to follow along!
